DATE: July 30, 2021
AUTHORS: Tama Parsons, Michael Sanja, Nicolas Rojas, and Chih-Hung(Toby) Wang 


================= PROBLEM DESCRIPTION ====================
You are to implement the abstract data type (ADT) for a linked list. The supplied interface LinkedListADT contains the signatures for the methods. 
SLL class must implement the LinkedListADT interface.
 Each abstract method defined in the LinkedListADT should be completely implemented, and any exceptions are to be appropriately propagated in the SLL class. 
The Node class represents a node in the linked list. 


============== PROBLEM SOLUTION DESCRIPTION ==============
You can this program to append, prepend, insert, replace, get sll size, delete, retrieve and find the indexof of the singly-Linked List  (SLL). 

===================== DEFICIENCIES =======================
None currently noted. 

===================== INSTRUCTIONS =======================
Step 1: Open your eclipse. 
Step 2: Import Group_7 Folder.
Step 3: Find Group_7 Folder.
Step 4: Find test folder under Group_7 Folder.
Step 5: Run the LinkedListTests.java AND SerializationTests.java.
Step 6: You can use the method in src/sait.sll/utility/SLL.java to implement any method to your SLL!
